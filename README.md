## Styles

### MDL

* just use basic CSS to help writing same styles
* import MDL styles and inject like `styles['mdl-button']`
* use custom classes if you want to add some styles to the MDL component

* don't use custom styled CSS (because it'll be CDN)
* don't use MDL JS (because it doesn't seem to work well with webpack)
